## Section 19. How to Set Up Points Account Ratio and Deduct Payment Amount

1. Enter the Platform Site - Application - Points Account, and enable points account setting.

Note:

A. After the current deduction setting is set successfully, the deduction ratio will apply to all items. If specific items require different deduction ratios, they can be set in the Free Deduction menu.

B. For example, if the payment amount is 10, the deduction ratio is 10%, and the conversion rate is 1:10, the account balance will be deducted by 10.

2. Two setting buttons will appear after enabling the points account. The "Sufficient Deduction" setting determines whether the current account limit needs to be equal to or greater than the deducted amount before any deduction can take place. The "Deduction Method" setting allows for the selection between single account and multiple accounts.

3. The user interface will show the points deducted, and the actual payment amount remaining.

For instance, if 16 points are used for deduction, the remaining actual payment will be 144 yuan.
