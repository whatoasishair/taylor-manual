# Section 5. Supply Chain Operating Manual

## Uploading Products by Own Supply Chain Merchants

The process of uploading products can be seen in previous chapter.

1. The agreed price is equivalent to the supplier's supply price, which is the purchase price of the platform.

2. The guide price is the default selling price for the consumer end if the platform does not modify it.

3. The market price is a reference price.

4. The cost price is only visible to the supplier.

After the supply chain platform side approves the upload, it will appear in the "Selection" section under "My Supply Chain" on the SaaS platform. The supplier can see the products they have uploaded. In the Centralized Management Platform, the pricing can be set and the selected product can be added. After logging into the SaaS merchant account and clicking on the supply chain application, the online selection can be used to select and shelve products from the Centralized Management Platform. After selecting the category, the product can be put up for sale in the merchant's inventory. The price can be modified with the product being available to order on the consumer end.
