## Section 36. Custom Payment Methods

1. Go to the platform side - Applications - Payment Methods - On-site Payment - Add and Set.

2. Fill in the basic setting, payment setting, and product setting in the Add and Set function.

Note: Be careful when setting the type. "Include" means the designated product can use the payment method, but other products cannot. "Exclude" means the designated product cannot use the payment method, but other products can.

3. For example, the strategy in the image means that the designated "Night Owl Grilled Fish Combo" cannot use "Balance 1" as a payment method, but other items from the platform can use this payment method.
