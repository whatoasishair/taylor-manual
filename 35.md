## Section 35. "3 for 1" Referral Promotion

1. Go to the platform side - Applications - Distribution Center - "3 for 1" Referral Promotion, click on Activity Management and create a strategy.

2. Click on Create Strategy and fill in the corresponding basic information. The gift settings not only offer "3 for 1," but also allow custom settings for referrals and commissions. If users want to participate in the activity, they need to make a purchase first and meet the activity threshold. Then, if the user's direct referral purchases the same item or the user purchases the same item, it unlocks the commission, and counts as referring the first friend and rewards the corresponding percentage. If the user purchases the same item again or directly refers another friend who buys the same item, it counts as referring the second friend and rewards the corresponding percentage.

3. After the user makes a purchase, they can check the records in the gift details.
