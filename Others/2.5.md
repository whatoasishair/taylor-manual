## 2.5 New Platform Domain Docking Process

1. Enter the control panel, click on Platform-New Platform-Enter the information and bind a second-level domain name that needs to be resolved later.

2. Go to the website to purchase a domain name: https://www.aliyun.com/, and find the domain name service in the Alibaba Cloud console.

3. After successfully creating the domain name, copy the CNAME domain name back to the Alibaba Cloud domain name background to resolve it.

4. Adding the resolution record takes about 10 minutes to take effect by default. After it takes effect, you can view the login link in the background.

If the domain name can enter the login page normally, it indicates that the configuration is normal, and then you need to configure the Qiniu cloud storage data.
