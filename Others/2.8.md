## Section 2.8 Mini Program Update Process

1. The process for updating a mini program is basically the same as binding it. After receiving notification from the technical team that the system needs to be updated, log in to the open platform and click on "Third-party Platform"- "Bound Account"- "Details". Click on "Developing Mini Program"- "Draft" (every time the data of the mini program is updated, a new data will be added to the draft. If there is no new data, it means the technical team hasn't updated it yet). Add it to the template library.

2. Click "Add to Template Library"- "Normal Template Library".

3. Record the template ID and version number.

4. Log in to the SaaS control panel, click "Settings"-- "Mini Program Version Release"-- "Publish New Version", enter the mini program template number and version number.

5. Click "Applications" on the SaaS platform side, then "Sales Channels", "Mini Program", and "Manual Release". Enter the version number and submit the version for review.

6. Submit for review. If approved, the update is complete.
