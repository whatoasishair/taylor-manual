## Section 4. Distribution Level Setting

Distribution Management: Members can receive commission rewards from orders placed by subordinate customers. If there is a referral relationship chain, for example, for A and B, where B is a first-level member under A, and C is a second-level member under A; the distribution level is a relative relationship. If it is a directly recommended relationship, it belongs to a first-level upper and lower relationship. However, if there is a one-level separation between C and A, it is an indirectly recommended relationship. For successful customers, their first-level upline C receives first-level commission, their second-level upline B receives second-level commission, and their third-level upline A receives third-level commission.

**To set up multiple levels of distributors, you need to first set them up in member levels. Once the distributors meet the conditions of the upper level, they can be upgraded to a higher level and receive the corresponding level of commission reward. Different levels can have different first-, second-, and third-level commission ratios. (Merchants can manage distributor level information, support editing level names, level weights (higher levels have greater weights), distributor level ratios, upgrade conditions (if not filled out, it will not be upgraded automatically), and delete functions.) See the picture below:**

### **1. Settlement method: settle with balance or points, calculate based on the actual payment amount or based on the profit of the product.**

### **2. Settlement days: support setting settlement days. Commission can only be settled after the settlement days are reached after the order is completed; if set to 0 or left empty, commission can be settled once order is completed. The backend settings are as follows (if the settlement days are set to "1 day", commission can only be withdrawn one day after the distribution order is completed):**

### **3. Settlement base: set the shipping cost in the order as a deduction. See the image below:**

### **Commission details: After the member becomes a distributor, the merchant can view the commission details in the backend. Distributor management supports searching for distributors based on order number, user search, and status (commissioned, pending, canceled) filtering conditions, making it easy for merchants to manage.
